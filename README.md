## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

The most difficult part of creating a website is to get the right size, padding, and margin of components.
I found out that I can set specific designs for specific properties.

### Continued development

I want to focus to learn more of css properties to create websites to perfection.
